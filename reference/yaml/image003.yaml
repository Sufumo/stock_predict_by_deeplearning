## Visual Summary
content_summary: This diagram visually illustrates the mechanism of graph attention, showing how node features are aggregated using attention coefficients computed via a softmax function.
key_insight: The main insight is that node i's new feature representation is computed by aggregating its neighbors' features, weighted by attention coefficients α_ij.

## Context Integration
contextual_relevance: |
  This diagram (图3) directly illustrates the graph attention mechanism described in the preceding mathematical formula, showing how the activation function and attention coefficients are used to aggregate node features in a graph neural network.

source_context:
  context_before: |
    $$\dot {{h_{{ι}}}}=\sigma \left(\sum _{{j\in N(i)}}\alpha _{{ij}}\widetilde {{h_{{J}}}}\right)$$
    其中， $0$ 表示激活函数，而 $\mathrm {{h}}_{{1}}$ 就是节点i的融合了其邻域信息的新特征，至此便完成了一轮节点特征的计算。
